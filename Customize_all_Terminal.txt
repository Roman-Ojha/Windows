=> install Nerd Font 
    -> we can chose between which font that we want for right now we are downloading 
        -> JetBrainsMono
            -> and install all the fonts

=> here we are using 'starship' prompt
    -> https://starship.rs/

    -> choco install starship (to install it you first need to install Chocolety)
    => For PowerShell
        -> code $PROFILE (to open the profile settings)
            -> now we have to add into the powershell file:
                -> Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
                    -> it means that it will run the starship automatically when we will open the windows powershell
